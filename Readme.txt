Brianna Zaffina & Suanna Shih readme:

To perform our code, follow these steps:
1. Upload all three of our files into your IDE (main.cpp, Algorithm1.h, Algorithm2.h) or open the directory of the files (depending on your IDE)
2. Run the code

Algorithm 1 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
1
---Test 1---
Priority #1: 50
Priority #1: 30
Priority #1: 40
Priority #1: 20
Priority #1: 10

FILO Order #1: 30
FILO Order #1: 20
FILO Order #1: 10

FIFO Order #1: 10
FIFO Order #1: 20
FIFO Order #1: 30

Algorithm 2 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
2
---Test 2---
List 1: 3 4 2
List 2: 9 6 5
Result is:
7 0 3 1

Boom! You're finished. main.cpp should compile test cases for all the requirements.
If you would like to add more test cases:

For Algorithm1:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 1" of the switch statement
	If you are trying to do user input, ensure that the input must be of string 	type and are either "priority", "stack", or "queue", as there is error bounds 	ensuring the string is exactly one of those strings.
For Algorithm2:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 2" of the switch statement
